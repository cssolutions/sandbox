## bs-grid
bs-grid takes the Bootstrap Grid, and puts it into your project for a light-weight grid system without all of the hassle of Bootstrap!


## Usage
Use `bower install bs-grid` to download the project.


If you want `less` files, go to `src/less/assets/stylesheets`.

If you want `scss` files, go to `src/scss/assets/stylesheets`.

If you would like just the `css` file, go to `dist/assets/stylesheets/bs-grid.css`.

## TODO:
Add `less` files.

Setup `gulpfile.js` to compile `less` files.

Test with more demos.
