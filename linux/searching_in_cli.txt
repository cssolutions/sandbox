Search for a file by name and type

types:
    f: regular file
    d: directory
    l: symbolic link
    c: character devices
    b: block devices

sizes:
    c: bytes
    k: Kilobytes
    M: Megabytes
    G: Gigabytes
    b: 512-byte blocks

find / -type f -name "error.log"

To find all files that are exactly 50 bytes, type:                  find / -size 50c
To find all files less than 50 bytes, we can use this form instead: find / -size -50c
To Find all files more than 700 Megabytes, we can use this command: find / -size +700M

To find files that have a modification time of a day ago, type:                        find / -mtime 1
If we want files that were accessed in less than a day ago, we can type:               find / -atime -1
To get files that last had their meta information changed more than 3 days ago, type:  find / -ctime +3

find /my/directory -newermt '-15 seconds' -not -newermt '-2 seconds'

Finding by Owner and Permissions
You do this by using the "-user" and "-group" parameters respectively. Find a file that is owned by the "syslog" user by entering: find / -user syslog
Similarly, we can specify files owned by the "shadow" group by typing: find / -group shadow
If we want to match an exact set of permissions, we use this form: find / -perm 644
If we want to specify anything with at least those permissions, you can use this form: find / -perm -644 This will match any files that have additional permissions. A file with permissions of "744" would be matched in this instance.

Finding those files in a directory, that last modification time is less or equal than a day
find /direcotry -mtime -1 -ls



Seach for a file containing the following text:

-r or -R is recursive,
-n is line number, and
-w stands match the whole word.
-l (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name of matching files.
Along with these, --exclude or --include parameter could be used for efficient searching. Something like below:

sudo grep -rnw / -e "tm.dev"

will exclude searching all the files ending with .o extension.: grep --exclude=*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
