<?php
function setUserCountryCode($userid, $countrycode)

$dbh = new DB_Mysql_Test;
$query = “ UPDATE users SET countrycode = :1 WHERE userid = :2 ” ;
$dbh->prepare($query)->execute($countrycode, $userid);
}

The Active Record pattern:
The distinguishing factor of the Active Record pattern is that the encapsulating class
will have an insert() , an update() , and a delete() method for synchronizing an
object with its associated database row. It should also have a set of finder methods to cre-
ate an object from its database row, given an identifier.
class Users() {}


The Mapper Pattern
