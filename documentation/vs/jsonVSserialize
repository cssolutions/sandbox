By default, json_encode() converts UTF-8 characters to Unicode escape sequences while serialize() does not. Note: To leave UTF-8 characters untouched, you can use the option JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE as of PHP 5.4.
JSON will have no memory of what the object's original class was (they are always restored as instances of stdClass).

Only public properties are serialized with JSON. Note: As of PHP 5.4, you can implement JsonSerializable to change this behavior.
